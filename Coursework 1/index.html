			<div class="col">Welcome to my Ciphers Coursework. I have chosen to use the Caeser Cipher and the Reverse Cipher. You can navigate to these using the links in the bar above</div>
			<div class="col">Julius Caesar was a brilliant military leader and effective Emperor leading Rome to annex a large portion of the world. Due to this he had many enemies and is understandble why he invented the Cipher to keep important information safe.</div>
			<div class="col">The Reverse Cipher flips the alphabet so the it is now backwards. It is a fairly simple Cipher and is quite fun to fool around with. Feel free to navigate to either of these Ciphers. Thanks for Reading.</div>
